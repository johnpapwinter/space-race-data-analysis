# space-race-data-analysis

This is a small data analysis project of all space launches from the 1940s till today.<br><br>
Scrapy was using to scrape the https://nextspaceflight.com/ and store the data on a csv file.<br>
Then, using Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas, several charts were drawn in an attempt to draw some conclusions on the history of space launches.<br><br>
The project is a variation of one of Dr. Angela Yu's series of suggestions on Python Portfolio projects. It was created for practice and fun :)
